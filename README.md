# opencvsharp5
Experimental OpenCV5 wrapper for .NET

# Concept
- I will try the new P/Invoke mechanism introduced in .NET 7.
- I makes only what is needed for me.
  - For me, OpenCvSharp is intended for use in server applications and does not require GUI, video input/output, etc.
  - I am not interested in running OpenCvSharp on Mac, Unity, MAUI, Raspberry Pi, UWP, etc.

# Requirements
- .NET 7

# Target Platforms
- Windows x64
- Linux x64
